# Changelog

All notable changes to Pier are documented here. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); before 1.0, minor versions may contain breaking changes.

## v0.0.1 — 2026-09-28

First developer preview: the Pier Host core (milestones M0 and M1). There is no desktop or mobile app yet; you drive the Host with the `pier-cli` debug client.

### Added

- **Pier Host** (`packages/host`), built on the pi SDK 0.87.1 and reusing pi's configuration (`~/.pi/agent`):
  - workspaces with per-workspace approval policies (`ask` / `smart` / `auto`), stored in `~/.pier/config.json`;
  - an active session pool (create, open, fork, rename, close, idle eviction) that is compatible with `pi --resume`;
  - an extension UI bridge (select / confirm / input / editor, notifications, status, widgets) where the first client to answer wins;
  - the built-in `pier-approval` extension (read-only whitelist, dangerous-command detection, allow once / for this session / deny with a reason);
  - a per-session event log with replay-or-snapshot resume after disconnects, and optional merging of streaming deltas;
  - session file locks and detection of external writes to session files;
  - a local WebSocket gateway on `127.0.0.1` with token authentication and an Origin allowlist.
- **Protocol v1.0** (`packages/protocol`, documented in `docs/protocol.md`).
- **Client library and `pier-cli`** (`packages/client`) with automatic reconnect and seq-based resume.
- **Single-file sidecar builds** made with `bun build --compile`, shipped together with pi's runtime assets.

### Release assets

`pier-host-v0.0.1-<os>-<arch>` archives for linux-x64, linux-arm64, darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, and windows-x64. Each archive contains the `pier-host` executable plus the pi assets it needs next to it; `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists the checksums. The binaries are not code-signed. On macOS, remove the quarantine attribute (`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine pier-host`) or allow the binary in System Settings.

### Known limitations

- Only local connections are supported. Remote access, pairing, and the mobile app arrive in M3.
- The desktop app (M2) is not included yet.
